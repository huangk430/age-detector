# Age Detector

### Dataset
We use the [IMDB-WIKI Faces](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/) dataset to train our model. To run our program you need to download/untar the [IMDB Faces File](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/static/imdb_crop.tar) and the [WIKI Faces File](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/static/wiki_crop.tar), and drop them into the "dataset" folder.

### Model
Our model is too large to save into GitHub, so we save it into Google Drive. To use our model, download the files from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16PHv37i6Ahb9lA-1qu0fN4tUkBX_QT9R?usp=sharing), and drop it into the cnn/model-versions/v1 folder.
